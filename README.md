# :video_game: First Person Perspective

In video games, first person is any graphical perspective rendered from the viewpoint of the player's character, or a viewpoint from the cockpit or front seat of a vehicle driven by the character. Many genres incorporate first-person perspectives, among them adventure games, driving, sailing, and flight simulators. Most notable is the first-person shooter, in which the graphical perspective is an integral component of the gameplay.
Games like Counter Strike, PUBG, GTA Vice City has such camera view for the player. (says Wikipedia)

- This is a basic FPP walk through.
- A map is designed to demonstrate the view

## :cloud: Installation

```shell
- Clone the Repository
- Run index.html
- That's it!!
```

## :video_game: Game Controls

Controls are pretty simple

- Arrow keys for movement along and orthogonal to the facing direction
- 'A' to turn left
- 'D' to turn right
- Use map to keep track of the position

## :beginner: Beginning till the End

Here is the first shot of this project

- Map is displayed in the top left corner to get the location of the user
- Red dot on the map represents the user
- White Shaded region around the dot represents the FOV (Field of View)
- Small features like walls are added to demonstrate the converging 'perspective' to the centre
- Then advanced map was designed for the full view
- Colors were added to give a good looking finish

## :hammer: Major Issues

Major issue with the perspective representation is FISHEYE Effect

- Tried to integrate cosine and sine functions to overcome that but still not perfect :neutral_face:
