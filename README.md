# :video_game: First Person Perspective 

In video games, first person is any graphical perspective rendered from the viewpoint of the player's character, or a viewpoint from the cockpit or front seat of a vehicle driven by the character. Many genres incorporate first-person perspectives, among them adventure games, driving, sailing, and flight simulators. Most notable is the first-person shooter, in which the graphical perspective is an integral component of the gameplay.
Games like Counter Strike, PUBG, GTA Vice City has such camera view for the player.

- This is a basic FPP walk through.
- A map is designed to demonstrate the view

- Map is displayed in the top left corner to get the location of the user
- Red dot on the map represents the user
- White Shaded region around the dot represents the FOV (Field of View)
- Small features like walls are added to demonstrate the converging 'perspective' to the centre
- Then advanced map was designed for the full view
- Colors were added to give a good looking finish

## :hammer: Issues

Major issue with the perspective representation is FISHEYE Effect
- Tried to integrate cosine and sine functions to overcome that but still not perfect :neutral_face:
